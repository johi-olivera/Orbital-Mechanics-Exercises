# 🪐 Astrodynamics with Python – UNSAM 2025

This repository documents my personal journey through the **Astrodynamics** course at UNSAM, part of my Space Systems Engineering degree. Here you'll find simulations, solved problems, and Python tools to better understand orbital motion — from vectors to conics, and everything in between.

## 🚀 What's Inside

This repo is a growing archive of exercises and concepts, including:

- 🛰️ Conversion between state vectors and classical orbital elements
- 📊 Orbital trajectory plotting (polar and Cartesian)
- 🔄 Anomaly conversions: true, eccentric, mean
- 🌌 Analysis of different orbit types: elliptical, hyperbolic, parabolic
- 📚 Implementations of Vallado’s algorithms (in Python)
- 🧪 Scripts for testing orbital propagation from initial conditions

Code is written with clarity in mind — explained, annotated, and ready for reuse in academic or hobby projects.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- Python 3.10+
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sgp4 (for TLE propagation)
